* Users can add, edit and remove notes. 
* A list of notes is displayed as a table. 
* The columns are a time of creation, note content, and note category. Categories are predefined: “Task”, “Random Thought”, and “Idea”.
* Notes in the table also display a list of dates mentioned in this note as a separate column. 
* Users can archive notes. Archived notes are not shown in the notes list. Users can view archived notes and unarchive them.
